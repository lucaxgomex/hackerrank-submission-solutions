This repository is dedicated to solving challenges from the [HackerRank](https://www.hackerrank.com/) platform. The solutions are organized into folders by challenge, category, and difficulty level. Each solution is implemented in multiple programming languages.

## Repository Structure

The repository is organized as follows:

- **Challenges**: Each challenge is stored in its own folder.
- **Categories**: Each challenge is organized by category (e.g., Algorithms, Data Structures, etc.).
- **Difficulty Levels**: Challenges are also organized by difficulty: Easy, Medium, and Hard.


## Programming Languages Used

Solutions are available in the following programming languages:

- **C#**
- **Ruby**
- **Scala**
- **JavaScript**
- **TypeScript**
- **Shell Script**
- **Python**
- **GoLang**

Each challenge folder contains solutions written in multiple languages, allowing for easy comparison of different approaches to the same problem.

## How to Navigate the Repository

1. **Challenges**: Each folder is named after a specific challenge from HackerRank.
2. **Categories**: The challenges are organized by category (e.g., Algorithms, Data Structures, etc.) to help you easily find solutions related to specific topics.
3. **Difficulty Levels**: Within each category, the challenges are further divided into difficulty levels:
   - **Easy**: Simple problems for beginners.
   - **Medium**: Intermediate problems that require more algorithmic thinking.
   - **Hard**: Advanced problems that involve complex algorithms or data structures.

Each folder contains the solution to a specific challenge in various programming languages. For example, for `Challenge-1`, there might be solutions in `C#`, `Python`, `JavaScript`, `Go`, etc.

## How to Contribute

If you would like to contribute to this repository, feel free to:

1. Fork the repository.
2. Add your solution to the relevant category, difficulty level, and challenge folder.
3. Submit a pull request with a description of the changes you’ve made.

## Example

Here is an example of what the directory structure and files might look like for a single challenge:

```
/algorithms
/easy
/challenge-1
solution.cs // C# solution
solution.rb // Ruby solution
solution.js // JavaScript solution
solution.py // Python solution
solution.go // GoLang solution
```

## Instructions

Each solution file contains the code required to solve the challenge in the corresponding language. The names of the solution files are consistent across languages, making it easy to compare different implementations.

## How to Run the Solutions

To run the solutions for a specific challenge, follow these steps:

1. Navigate to the challenge folder:
```bash
cd Algorithms/Easy/Challenge-1
```

2. Choose the solution file for your desired language. For example, for Python:

```python
python solution.py
```

Or for C#:

```c#
dotnet run solution.cs
```

3. Follow any additional instructions in the comments of the solution files (if provided) to run the solution and input/output requirements.


### Explanation of the Structure:

1. **Repository Structure**: The challenges are organized by categories (e.g., Algorithms, Data Structures), and each category has subfolders for different difficulty levels (Easy, Medium, Hard). Inside each difficulty folder, individual challenge folders contain solutions written in different programming languages.

2. **Programming Languages**: The README specifies the languages in which solutions are available, making it clear that solutions in C#, Ruby, Scala, JavaScript, TypeScript, Shell Script, Python, and Go are available for each challenge.

3. **How to Navigate**: Clear instructions are provided on how to navigate the repository, emphasizing the organization by category, difficulty level, and language.

4. **Contribution**: The README invites others to contribute by forking the repository and adding their own solutions in the appropriate folders.

5. **Example**: An example is provided to demonstrate the structure of a single challenge folder and how the solutions are named consistently across different languages.

6. **How to Run**: Instructions on how to run solutions for a specific challenge in various programming languages are included.
